# Getting Started

## Account Creation  
- Only Shibboleth using a UCLA ID
- See UCLA Identity and Accounts Manager:  https://accounts.iam.ucla.edu/#/
- Contact DSC for assistance

## Logging into Dataverse
- Log in at https://dataverse.ucla.edu/
- Click the “Log In” link in the navbar.
- UCLA uses an Institutional Log-in. Choose “University of California, Los Angeles”
- Users will __not__ be using the account creation options since they should have a UCLA account before they are accessing our Dataverse.
